# Generalized-Multiplayer-Thin-film-Structure-Reflectivity-Solver
## Introduction and Motivation of Sharing
This is a project assigned on and modified from Stanford EE 236A Modern Optics. Optical industry vendors typically developed their internal solvers since multilayer optical films have been extensively used in optical technology [1]. It is targeted to build a Matlab solver by using impedance method to calculate the reflectivity/emissivity of a multiplayer thin-film. 
## Discussion and Futher Plan
This project is useful for 1-D conceptual and numerical validation of multi-layer design. Upon demand for smaller granularity of applcation and
